# cryptomancy-prime

This module implements primality tests used to select keys for use in cryptosystems relying on BigInteger modular exponentiation.

It was extracted from [forge](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/forge/blob/master/lib/prime.js), and modified only slightly so as to better support synchronous and asyncronous workflows.
